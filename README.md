Tourney is an iOS mobile application that allows extreme sports athletes to compete against each other - regardless of their location
How athletes compete:
1. Find a challenge or contest to join 
2. View challenge/contest criteria
3. Record or upload 10 second video in-app
4. User with the most amount of votes wins after specified time period
5. Winner gets to set the criteria for the next challenge/contest

Tourney was created thanks to advice from Jamie Bestwick (UK British Olympic Coach) and Jack Zerby.
Participants were mainly professional BMX athletes from well-known brands such as Monster Energy, Rockstar Energy, RedBull, and Camp Woodward.
